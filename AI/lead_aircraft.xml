  <description>
     The following scenario puts an aerial tanker in orbit over
     KSFO at 3000 ft AGL. The tanker uses the 737 model,
     but you can use any model (a KC-135 model can be
     found at:
     http://home.comcast.net/~davidculp2/hangar/hangar.html).
     The center of the orbit is actually west of KSFO, and the
     eastern edge of the orbit passes over the airport.  Note
     that AI aircraft do not react to wind, therefore your speed
     and bank angle will have to vary along the orbit since
     your "user" aircraft *does* react to the wind.

     I recommend using the T-38 as your airplane for four
     reasons: (1) it has a radar screen which may be needed
     to find the tanker;  (2) it has the speed to catch the
     tanker; (3) it uses a JSBSim FDM, which means it can
     onload fuel; (4) it has a green light added to the
     instrument panel, between the fuel gauges, which comes
     on when you are in the refueling envelope.

     Right now the air refueling envelope is very loose, and I
     plan on tightening it up in the future.  Currently no
     aerodynamic effects of refueling are modeled
     (i.e downwash, bow wave, vortices).
