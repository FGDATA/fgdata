		<description>
			The following scenario puts an aerial tanker in orbit over
			KSFO at 3000 ft AGL. The tanker uses the 737 model,
			but you can use any model (a KC-135 model can be
			found at:
			http://home.comcast.net/~davidculp2/hangar/hangar.html).
			The center of the orbit is actually west of KSFO, and the
			eastern edge of the orbit passes over the airport.  Note
			that AI aircraft do not react to wind, therefore your speed
			and bank angle will have to vary along the orbit since
			your "user" aircraft *does* react to the wind.

			I recommend using the T-38 as your airplane for four
			reasons: (1) it has a radar screen which may be needed
			to find the tanker;  (2) it has the speed to catch the
			tanker; (3) it uses a JSBSim FDM, which means it can
			onload fuel; (4) it has a green light added to the
			instrument panel, between the fuel gauges, which comes
			on when you are in the refueling envelope.

			Right now the air refueling envelope is very loose, and I
			plan on tightening it up in the future.  Currently no
			aerodynamic effects of refueling are modeled
			(i.e downwash, bow wave, vortices).
