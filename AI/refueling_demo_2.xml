			The following scenario puts an aerial tanker in a N/S
			towline starting over KSFO at 8000 ft AGL. The tanker
			uses the KC-135 model, but you can use any model.

			Note that AI aircraft do not react to wind, therefore your
			speed and bank angle will have to vary along the orbit
			since your "user" aircraft *does* react to the wind.

			I recommend using the T-38 as your airplane for four
			reasons: (1) it has a radar screen which may be needed
			to find the tanker;  (2) it has the speed to catch the
			tanker; (3) it uses a JSBSim FDM, which means it can
			onload fuel; (4) it has a green light added to the
			instrument panel, between the fuel gauges, which comes
			on when you are in the refueling envelope.

			The A4F also has a refueling capabilty using
			YASim, with a green light in the fuel level gauge.
			It also has a nav-display which can be set to
			display the A/A TACAN position of the channel
			listed below.

			Right now the air refueling envelope is very loose, and I
			plan on tightening it up in the future.  Currently no
			aerodynamic effects of refueling are modeled
			(i.e downwash, bow wave, vortices).
