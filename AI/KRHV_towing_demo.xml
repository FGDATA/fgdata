  <description>
     This scenario has a J3 takeoff from runway 31L at
     KRHV for aerotowing You can
     change the aircraft type by substituting another model in
     the &lt;model&gt; tag, and you can also change the "flight
     plan" by changing the &lt;flightplan&gt; tag. Look in the
     subdirectory FlightPlans to find some that I've already
     defined, including some arrivals.  Normally, when an AI
     aircraft gets to the end of its flight plan it deletes itself,
     however the &lt;repeat&gt;1&lt;/repeat&gt; tag will cause the AI
     aircraft to start again indefinitely.
