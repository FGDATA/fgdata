Each instrument is composed of layers stacked on top of each other.
A layer may be a texture (with transparent parts to show the layers
underneath), text, or a special layer that switches between two
others (say, to turn an indicator light on or off).  Each layer can
move independently in proportion to a property value, and text
can be generated from property values as well: all of the layer's
movements are defined as transformations.

Actions are hotspots on the instrument that will respond to a mouse
click.  Actions always modify the values of properties, either by
adjusting them, toggling them, or swaping them with other
properties' values.
