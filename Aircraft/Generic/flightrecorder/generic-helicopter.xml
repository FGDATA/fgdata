<!-- Generic flight recorder configuration for helicopters: main + tail rotor, 2 tanks.
     Tested with YASim helicopters.

     Note: The generic configurations are provided as an example and for convenience only.
     No need to use a generic configuration. You can copy the settings below to your aircraft's
     flight recorder configuration and include a better combination of recorder components, if
     none of the pre-defined configurations fits your aircraft.
