To enable full functionality of the SCR-522C/TR1133 radio there are several things 
that need to be done.  

First change the <nasal> section of your *set.xml file so that it looks like the 
following.  

<nasal>
   <!-- your other nasal files -->
   <!-- the following three lines must be exactly like this -->
   <SCR_522C>
      <file>Aircraft/Instruments-3d/SCR-522C/Nasal/SCR-522C.nas</file>
   </SCR_522C>
</nasal>

Menu:

The above will enable the F12 key to bring up the SCR-522C specific frequencies dialog. It 
will also over ride the Equipment --> radios menu item so that it brings up the correct 
menu for the SCR-522C/TR1133 radios.  This also implements other radio features like support 
for a remote TR switch,  the TR switch on the BC-602-A control box,  TR switch lock, channel 
switching, power switch and so on.

Animation:

For dark conditions when cabin/cockpit illumination is used all of the radio models objects 
are illuminated in response to 

<property>/controls/lighting/cabin-norm</property>

If you are using a different property for your cabin/cockpit lights you will need to map your 
lighting property to /controls/lighting/cabin-norm.

If your aircraft needs remote ptt button animation this should be linked to

instrumentation/comm/SCR-522C/remote-pushed 

Since the Nasal script reimplements controls.ptt() and instrumentation/comm/ptt only becomes true
if the radio is turned on.  Using the property above to control the animation of the remote ptt 
button will result in the botton moving when ever the user pushes what ever key/button they have
setup to call controls.ptt().  An example of what this might look like is:
    
 <animation>
  <type>translate</type>
  <object-name>MicButton</object-name>
  <property>instrumentation/comm/SCR-522C/remote-pushed</property>
  <factor>-0.007</factor>
  <axis>
   <x>0</x>
   <y>1</y>
   <z>0</z>
  </axis>
 </animation>
