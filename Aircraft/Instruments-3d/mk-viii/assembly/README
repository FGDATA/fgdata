This directory contains a cockpit assembly model and XSLT
stylesheet. An assembly is a lamp/switch combination. The lamp is
implemented via two texture files representing the on/off states. The
assembly can be latching (press to toggle, self-annunciating lamp) or
momentary (press to activate, lamp driven by an external property). An
optional guard is provided.

The stylesheet can be used to generate the assemblies you need using
an XSLT 1.1 processor. See Aircraft/Instruments-3d/mk-viii for an
example.
