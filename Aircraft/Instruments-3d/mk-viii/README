This directory contains a set of standard GPWS assemblies (lamp format
2), connected to /instrumentation/mk-viii. Use them by referencing the
XML files from your aircraft model file (see
Aircraft/b1900d/Models/b1900d-anim.xml for an example), and by setting
/sim/mk-viii/assemblies/emission/* to off-state emission values, for
instance:

	<sim>
	  <mk-viii>
	    <assemblies>
	      <emission>
		<red>0.5</red>
		<green>0.5</green>
		<blue>0.5</blue>
		<factor alias="/controls/lighting/instruments-norm"/>
	     </emission>
	  </mk-viii>
	</sim>
