    Additional elements are required for a supercharged engine.  These can be
    left off a non-supercharged engine, ie. the changes are all backward
    compatible at present.

    - NUMBOOSTSPEEDS - zero (or not present) for a naturally-aspirated engine,
      either 1, 2 or 3 for a boosted engine.  This corresponds to the number of
      supercharger speeds.  Merlin XII had 1 speed, Merlin 61 had 2, a late
      Griffon engine apparently had 3.  No known engine more than 3, although
      some German engines apparently had a continuously variable-speed
      supercharger.

    - BOOSTOVERRIDE - whether the boost pressure control system (either a boost
      control valve for superchargers or wastegate for turbochargers) can be
      overriden by the pilot.  During wartime this was commonly possible, and
      known as "War Emergency Power" by the Brits.  1 or 0 in the config file.
      This isn't implemented in the model yet though, there would need to be
      some way of getting the boost control cutout lever position (on or off)
      from FlightGear first.

    - The next items are all appended with either 1, 2 or 3 depending on which
      boost speed they refer to, eg RATEDBOOST1.  The rated values seems to have
      been a common convention at the time to express the maximum continuously
      available power, and the conditions to attain that power.

    - RATEDBOOST[123] - the absolute rated boost above sea level ambient for a
      given boost speed, in psi.  Eg the Merlin XII had a rated boost of 9psi,
      giving approximately 42inHg manifold pressure up to the rated altitude.

    - RATEDALTITUDE[123] - The altitude up to which rated boost can be
      maintained.  Up to this altitude the boost is maintained constant for a
      given throttle position by the BCV or wastegate.  Beyond this altitude the
      manifold pressure must drop, since the supercharger is now at maximum
      unregulated output.  The actual pressure multiplier of the supercharger
      system is calculated at initialisation from this value.

    - RATEDPOWER[123] - The power developed at rated boost at rated altitude at
      rated rpm.

    - RATEDRPM[123] - The rpm at which rated power is developed.

    - TAKEOFFBOOST - Takeoff boost in psi above ambient.  Many aircraft had an
      extra boost setting beyond rated boost, but not totally uncontrolled as in
      the already mentioned boost-control-cutout, typically attained by pushing
      the throttle past a mechanical 'gate' preventing its inadvertant use. This
      was typically used for takeoff, and emergency situations, generally for
      not more than five minutes.  This is a change in the boost control
      setting, not the actual supercharger speed, and so would only give extra
      power below the rated altitude.  When TAKEOFFBOOST is specified in the
      config file (and is above RATEDBOOST1), then the throttle position is
      interpreted as:

    - 0 to 0.95 : idle manifold pressure to rated boost (where attainable)
    - 0.96, 0.97, 0.98 : rated boost (where attainable).
    - 0.99, 1.0 : takeoff boost (where attainable).

    A typical takeoff boost for an earlyish Merlin was about 12psi, compared
    with a rated boost of 9psi.

    It is quite possible that other boost control settings could have been used
    on some aircraft, or that takeoff/extra boost could have activated by other
    means than pushing the throttle full forward through a gate, but this will
    suffice for now.

    Note that MAXMP is still the non-boosted max manifold pressure even for
    boosted engines - effectively this is simply a measure of the pressure drop
    through the fully open throttle.
