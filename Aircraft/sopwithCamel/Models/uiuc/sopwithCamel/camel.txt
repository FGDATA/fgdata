SOPWITH CAMEL

This is Camel Nr 5 from the Belgian Air Force flown by the "White
Crows" (witte raven) 4th Squad during 1917-1918.  The Camel was first
flown on May 17, 1917, and was the Allies premier fighter in WWI.
Designed to replace the unsuccessful Sopwith "Pup", it quickly went
into production and a total of 5,490 were built.  The "Camel"
demonstrated good handling and its armament of two 7.62 mm Maxim or
two Vickers 0.030 machine guns was formidable.  The name "Camel" was
derived from the hump-shaped cover over the machine guns.  It shot
down more enemy aircraft than any other fighter of any of the warring
nations.  However, because of its tricky handling characteristics,
more men lost their lives while learning to fly it than died while
using it in combat.  The Camel was produced in Great Britain and went
into action in June 1917 with the 70 Squadron ,Royal Flying Corps and
4 Squadron, Royal Naval Air Service.  In the hands of an experienced
pilot, the Camel was strong and agile but prone to springing surprises
on the inexperienced pilot.  The Camel was a fighter pilot's dream
come true.  It was fast, it was highly manoeuverable and at its best
combat altitude of 12,000 feet, it was very difficult to defeat in a
dogfight, and came equipped with two machine guns synchronized to fire
forward through the propeller arc, but it was not suitable for the
novice.  It could out turn any German aircraft of the time.  If
handled without respect, would throw itself into a dangerous spin.  If
the pilot was experienced and adept at flying he could usually master
the quirks of the Camel, if not, the pilot in training frequently
died.  It was a very powerful aircraft
