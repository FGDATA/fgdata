Hi AF,

You might be interested in knowing that I have used your Sopwith Camel
model (nice work!) in my work with Flightgear
(http://www.flightgear.org).  I developed the aerodynamic model and
your 3D model is used for the external view.

My question is could I get your permission to include your 3D model w/
the Flightgear distribution (open source under the GPL).  To include
the model w/ Flightgear means that it would carry the GPL license.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Michael

Hallo Michael,

Thanks a lot for your nice remarks on the Sopwith Camel.  Long time
ago I once tried the Flightgear sim, but it took a lot of resources
from my Pentium 2 PC.

It's my pleasure to allow you to use the Sopwith Camel in Flightgear.

I might even try the Flightgear sim again on my new Pentium 4 PC.
Keep up the good work!

Cheers, Scrubby
