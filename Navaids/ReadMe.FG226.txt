FlightGear airport, nav-aid and intersection (fix) data
*******************************************************

Version
=======

This is version 2.26 of the FlightGear airport, nav-aid and IFR intersection data.  See the Change Log section at the end of this file for complete details of changes.  

The source data for these files is also used for the X-Plane flight simulator, and X-Plane users have provided the bulk of the updated data for this release.  Many of the comments in the change log may only be relevant to X-Plane users.  Sorry!


Notes
=====

Please advise me if you are working upon custom taxiways for an airport.  I will try and co-ordinate/avoid duplications of effort.

I have now written an FAQ (in MS Word format) that attempts to explain the rather curious file formats used in default.apt, default.nav, default.ils and default.fix.  Contact me if you would like a copy.


Feedback
========

As always, please send feedback to robin@cpwd.com.
 
- If you find errors, please just don't tell me (as many do) that "...it's all wrong ..." - please also tell me how to put it right! 

- If I seem to have done strange things to any data you send me - I'm sorry - let me know what is wrong and I'll do my best to fix it.  I do not have time to test fly every airport and ILS!  The software that consolidates all this data is complex, and still has a few bugs that need to be eradicated.  And sometimes I receive conflicting data for the same airport.  But I do keep copies of everything I am sent, and so it should be possible to resolve any problems that arise.
