<!--
	To override or add "named" joystick drivers list them in
	<js-named> entries with paths relative to the directory where
	the joysticks.xml file resides (first example). Such "named"
	drivers are only picked up if one of their <name>s matches
	the joystick hardware (see output of the js_demo application).
	These drivers have precedence over already existing drivers
	with the same <name>. (You can also add a <name>default</name>
	entry to the driver to make it the default choice.)

	The second example shows how to load a driver directly to
	position 0. This will then be used for the first joystick on
	your system and FlightGear will not overwrite it.
