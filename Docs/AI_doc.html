<h3>Using AI objects in FlightGear</h3><hr>
<br><br>
Starting with FlightGear version 0.9.4 you can place AI objects in the "FlightGear world".
  In version 0.9.4 the AI objects can be defined in the <b><tt>preferences.xml</tt></b> file, or 
  in an airplane's <b><tt>*-set.xml</tt></b> file. In later versions of FlightGear they are 
  defined in a "scenario file" only.  Types of AI objects available are ships, airplanes, 
  thunderstorms, thermals, aircraft carriers, static and ballistic objects.
<BR><BR>  

AI objects have some things in common:  The have a location in the "FlightGear world", 
they can have an associated exterior 3D model, and they can move according to an internal 
FDM (flight dynamics model).  As of now, these objects are created at simulator start-up 
by adding some XML code to a scenario file. The scenario file must be in the 
<b><tt>data/Data/AI</tt></b> directory. You select which scenario file you want to use by naming 
it in the <b><tt>preferences.xml</tt></b> file.  (Note: As with everything in the 
<b><tt>preferences.xml</tt></b> file, the entries can be overridden by an aircraft's 
<b><tt>*-set.xml</tt></b> file, or at the command line.)  The <b><tt>preferences.xml</tt></b> 
file has an entry that looks like this (FlightGear versions newer than 0.9.4):
<BR><BR>

<b><tt>
  &#60;ai><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;enabled type="bool">true&#60;/enabled><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;scenario>demo_scenario&#60;/scenario><br>
  &#60;/ai><br>
</tt></b>
<BR><BR>

The scenario contains one entry for each AI object.  The entry specifies what kind of 
object to create, what it's initial conditions will be, and optionally (for aircraft and 
ships) a flight plan.
<BR><BR><BR>

<h3>Ships</h3><hr>
The entry to create a sailboat would look like this:
<br><br>

<b><tt>
  &#60;entry><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;type>ship&#60;/type><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;path>AI/Aircraft/sailboat1/sailboat.xml&#60;/path><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;speed type="double">12.0&#60;/speed><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;altitude type="double">0.0&#60;/altitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;longitude type="double">-122.33333&#60;/longitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;latitude type="double">37.61667&#60;/latitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;heading type="double">20.0&#60;/heading><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;rudder type="double">-3.0&#60;/rudder><br>
  &#60;/entry><br>
</tt></b>
<BR><BR>

Most of the entries are self-explanatory.  The "type" of object can be one of "aircraft", 
"ship", "storm", "thermal", "carrier", "static" or "ballistic".  The rest of the items 
give the AI object a model, a starting location, and a starting speed and direction.  You 
use the <b>&#60;path&#62;</b> item to give the object any valid exterior model. You can even 
make the ship look like an airplane if you want!  The "ship" type can also have a 
<b>&#60;rudder&#62;</b> value specified, which will cause the ship to move in a circle 
(HINT: use small values, five degrees or less, and right rudder is positive). 
<BR><BR>

<h3>Aircraft</h3><hr>
Here is an example of how to create an aircraft AI object:
<BR><BR>

<b><tt>
  &#60;!-- puts an A-4 north of KSFO, orbiting at 7000 ft  --><br>
  &#60;entry><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;type>aircraft&#60;/type><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;class>jet_fighter&#60;/class><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;path>Aircraft/a4/Models/a4-blue.xml&#60;/path><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;speed type="double">320.0&#60;/speed><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;altitude type="double">7000.0&#60;/altitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;longitude type="double">-122.6&#60;/longitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;latitude type="double">37.9&#60;/latitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;heading type="double">210.0&#60;/heading><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;roll type="double">-15.0&#60;/roll><br>
  &#60;/entry>
</tt></b>
<BR><BR>

It looks much the same as the ship AI code.  There are two differences, the 
<b>&#60;class&#62;</b> item and the <b>&#60;roll&#62;</b> item.  If the class is set to 
"tanker" the airplane will allow you to refuel if you can get close behind it (so far 
supported by JSBSim only)  The "roll" will cause the airplane to fly in a circle.  In the 
above example the A-4 will be orbiting to the left at 15 degrees of bank.  You can also 
create a ship or airplane with a flight plan.  In this case the object will follow the 
flight plan and then delete itself when it reaches the end, or (new since version 0.9.8) 
the object can be set to endlessly repeat a flight plan.  The flight plans are located in 
<b><tt>data/Data/AI/FlightPlans</tt></b>.  To create an airplane with a flightplan do this:
<BR><BR>

<b><tt>
  &#60;entry><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;type>aircraft&#60;/type><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;class>jet-transport&#60;/class><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;path>Aircraft/737/Models/737.xml&#60;/path><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;flightplan>KSFO_ILS28L.xml&#60;/flightplan><br>
  &#60;/entry><br>
</tt></b>
<BR><BR>


In this case you don't need to specify initial conditions because they are already defined 
in the flight plan.  The AI aircraft objects can be displayed on radar.  See the 
<b><tt>Aircraft/Instruments/radar.xml</tt></b> file for details.  

<BR><BR>
<h3>Thunderstorms</h3><hr>
<BR>
To make a thunderstorm, use this:
<BR><BR>

<b><tt>
  &#60;!-- puts a thunderstorm overhead OSI (Woodside VOR) --><br>
  &#60;entry><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;type>storm&#60;/type><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;path>Models/Geometry/thunderstorm.xml&#60;/path><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;speed type="double">20.0&#60;/speed><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;altitude type="double">4000.0&#60;/altitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;latitude type="double">37.3917&#60;/latitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;longitude type="double">-122.2817&#60;/longitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;heading type="double">90&#60;/heading><br>
  &#60;/entry><br>
</tt></b>
<BR><BR>

There's not much to it.  No, they don't turn :)  New since version 0.9.8 is the ability
to add lightning and turbulence to a thunderstorm.  For an example of this see the scenario 
file called "bigstorm_demo.xml".  The AI storm objects can be displayed on weather radar.  See the 
<b><tt>Aircraft/Instruments/wxradar.xml</tt></b> file for details.  

<br><br>
<h3>Thermals</h3><hr>
<BR>
To create a thermal, use this:
<BR><BR>

<b><tt>
 &#60;!-- puts a thermal over the control tower at KSFO --><br>
 &#60;entry><br>
 &nbsp; &#60;type>thermal&#60;/type><br>
 &nbsp; &#60;latitude type="double">37.61633&#60;/latitude><br>
 &nbsp; &#60;longitude type="double">-122.38334&#60;/longitude><br>
 &nbsp; &#60;strength-fps type="double">8.33&#60;/strength-fps><br>
 &nbsp; &#60;diameter-ft type="double">4000.0&#60;/diameter-ft><br>
 &nbsp; &#60;height-msl type="double">6000.0&#60;/height-msl><br>
 &#60;/entry><br>
</tt></b>
<BR><BR>

The AI thermals don't move, they are invisible, and they don't "lean" downwind.  
The <b>&#60;strength-fps&#62;</b> defines the maximum vertical velocity of the airmass 
at the center of the thermal.  The strength decreases to zero at the thermal's edge.  
<b>&#60;height-msl&#62;</b> defines the top of the thermal.
  

<br><br>
<h3>Ballistic objects</h3><hr>
<br>
A ballistic AI object starts with an initial location, azimuth, elevation and speed, then 
follows a ballistic path from there (with air resistance included).  Try this:
<BR><BR>

<b><tt>
  &#60;entry><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;type>ballistic&#60;/type><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;path>Models/Geometry/rocket.xml&#60;/path><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;speed type="double">500.0&#60;/speed><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;altitude type="double">50.0&#60;/altitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;longitude type="double">-122.39&#60;/longitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;latitude type="double">37.62&#60;/latitude><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;heading type="double">200.0&#60;/heading><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;azimuth type="double">70.0&#60;/azimuth><br>
  &nbsp; &#60;elevation type="double">45.0&#60;/elevation><br>
  &#60;/entry><br>
</tt></b>
<BR><BR>

There is not much call for rocket launches in FlightGear, but the ballistic AI object is
the basis for FlightGear's <a href="README.submodels">submodels</a> system.

<BR><BR><BR>
<h3>Aircraft Carriers</h3><hr>
<br>
The aircraft carrier AI object is based on the "ship" object but is much more complicated.  
See the scenario file called <b><tt>nimitz_demo.xml</tt></b> for details.
