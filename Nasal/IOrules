# This file defines which file paths can be opened for reading and/or
# writing using Nasal's io.open() and parsexml() functions, as well as
# the fgcommands load, save, loadxml, and savexml. The evaluation code
# can be found in $FG_ROOT/Nasal/io.nas.
#
# Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored. All other entries
# must be of the form
#
#   {READ|WRITE} {ALLOW|DENY} <path-pattern>
#
# whereby fields must be separated by exactly one space. The pattern must
# not be quoted and may contain spaces. If a pattern starts with $FG_ROOT/
# or $FG_HOME/, then these parts are replaced by the respective system
# paths. See $FG_ROOT/Nasal/string.nas for the pattern syntax.
#
# Entries are considered from top down. If no entry matches, then file
# access is denied. A local rules file $FG_HOME/Nasal/IOrules using the
# same syntax takes precedence over this file. The default rules that
# apply if there's no Nasal/IOrules file at all, or there are no rules
# defined in it are equivalent to this:
#
#   READ DENY *
#   WRITE DENY *
#
# Read and write access to Nasal/IOrules files, however, is *always*
# prohibited and not configurable!
