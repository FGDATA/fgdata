*	Several .dds files to improve ground appearance

*	A new experimental transition effect.
	You will find examples of its usage in the effects inheriting from it.
	It's not recommended to use the effect directly, but create a new one that inherits from it and defines the number of transitions, and the textures you want to transition to.

*	You will find more info in the transition.eff file itself.


Installation notes:
*	There is an alternative materials file named materials-dds.xml included. You can activate this file by using

 --prop:/sim/rendering/materials-file=materials-dds.xml

You can replace materials-dds.xml with your own version if you prefer:

 --prop:/sim/rendering/materials-file=your-filename.xml
