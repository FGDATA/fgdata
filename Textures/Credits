Some of our textures are based on images provided by spaceimaging.com, who has
allowed us to use it's satellite images for both commercial and non-commercial
use, provided the original image can't be extracted  from the textures.
Since our textures are often a very small portion of the whole image, split up
and rearranged to make it seamless, this shouldn't be a problem.

Here are two sets of textures in windows .bmp form that you can use. 
They are my original creations and I'd like to get credit for them 
if you end up using them in Flight Gear. If you find you want to 
change them or need additional textures, please let me know and 
I'll do my best to provide you with something you can use.
