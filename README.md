<h1>IMPORTANT</h1>


This FGDATA was intended as a test to experiment submodules as an strategy 
to develop Aircraft for flightgear in individual repositories<br>

This TEST FGDATA will no longer be updated.<br>

An official FGDATA repository without Aircraft is 
located at: https://sourceforge.net/p/flightgear/fgdata/ci/next/tree/ <br>

A fork of the official FGDATA repository with Aircraft added as submodules, 
derived from this test is now hosted at: https://sourceforge.net/p/fgdata/submodules/ci/next/tree/
</br>

<h4>Sourceforge has been chosen for a host of the FGDATA repo, among other considerations, due to its large size (currently at 1.3G)</h4>
